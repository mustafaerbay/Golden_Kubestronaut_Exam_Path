# Scheduling Pod Anti Affinity

There is a Pod YAML provided at /root/hobby.yaml .

That Pod should be required to be only scheduled on Nodes where no Pods with label level=restricted are running.

For the topologyKey use kubernetes.io/hostname .

There are no taints on any Nodes which means no tolerations are needed.

```

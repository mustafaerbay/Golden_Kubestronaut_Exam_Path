# Question 8 | Get Controlplane Information
Solve this question on: ssh cka8448

Check how the controlplane components kubelet, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager and etcd are started/installed on the controlplane node.

Also find out the name of the DNS application and how it's started/installed in the cluster.

Write your findings into file /opt/course/8/controlplane-components.txt. The file should be structured like:

```
# /opt/course/8/controlplane-components.txt
kubelet: [TYPE]
kube-apiserver: [TYPE]
kube-scheduler: [TYPE]
kube-controller-manager: [TYPE]
etcd: [TYPE]
dns: [TYPE] [NAME]
```
Choices of [TYPE] are: not-installed, process, static-pod, pod

### Answer

We could start by finding processes of the requested components, especially the kubelet at first:

```
➜ ssh cka8448

➜ candidate@cka8448:~$ sudo -i

➜ root@cka8448:~# ps aux | grep kubelet
```
We can see which components are controlled via systemd looking at /usr/lib/systemd directory:

```
➜ root@cka8448:~# find /usr/lib/systemd | grep kube
/usr/lib/systemd/user/podman-kube@.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/podman-kube@.service
```
```
➜ root@cka8448:~# service kubelet status

```
```
➜ root@cka8448:~# find /usr/lib/systemd | grep etcd
```

This shows kubelet is controlled via systemd, but no other service named kube nor etcd. It seems that this cluster has been setup using kubeadm, so we check in the default manifests directory:

```
➜ root@cka8448:~# find /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
```

The kubelet could also have a different manifests directory specified via a KubeletConfiguration, but the one above is the default one.

This means the main 4 controlplane services are setup as static Pods. Actually, let's check all Pods running on in the kube-system Namespace:

```
➜ root@cka8448:~# k -n kube-system get pod -o wide
NAME                              ...   NODE      
coredns-6f8b9d9f4b-8z7rb          ...   cka8448   
coredns-6f8b9d9f4b-fg7bt          ...   cka8448   
etcd-cka8448                      ...   cka8448   
kube-apiserver-cka8448            ...   cka8448   
kube-controller-manager-cka8448   ...   cka8448   
kube-proxy-dvv7m                  ...   cka8448   
kube-scheduler-cka8448            ...   cka8448   
weave-net-gjrxh                   ...   cka8448    
```

Above we see the 4 static pods, with -cka8448 as suffix.

We also see that the dns application seems to be coredns, but how is it controlled?

```
➜ root@cka8448$ kubectl -n kube-system get ds
NAME         DESIRED   ...   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
kube-proxy   1         ...   kubernetes.io/os=linux   67m
weave-net    1         ...   <none>                   67m

➜ root@cka8448$ k -n kube-system get deploy
NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
coredns   2/2     2            2           68m
```

Seems like coredns is controlled via a Deployment. We combine our findings in the requested file:

```
# /opt/course/8/controlplane-components.txt
kubelet: process
kube-apiserver: static-pod
kube-scheduler: static-pod
kube-controller-manager: static-pod
etcd: static-pod
dns: pod coredns
```

You should be comfortable investigating a running cluster, know different methods on how a cluster and its services can be setup and be able to troubleshoot and find error sources.

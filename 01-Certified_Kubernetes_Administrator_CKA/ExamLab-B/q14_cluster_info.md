# Question 14 | Find out Cluster Information
Solve this question on: ssh cka8448

You're ask to find out following information about the cluster:

- How many controlplane nodes are available?
- How many worker nodes (non controlplane nodes) are available?
- What is the Service CIDR?
- Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?
- Which suffix will static pods have that run on cka8448?

Write your answers into file /opt/course/14/cluster-info, structured like this:
```
# /opt/course/14/cluster-info
1: [ANSWER]
2: [ANSWER]
3: [ANSWER]
4: [ANSWER]
5: [ANSWER]

Answer:


How many controlplane and worker nodes are available?

```
➜ ssh cka8448

➜ candidate@cka8448:~$ k get node
NAME      STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
cka8448   Ready    control-plane   71m   v1.33.1
```
We see one controlplane and no worker nodes.

What is the Service CIDR?
```
➜ candidate@cka8448:~$ sudo -i

➜ root@cka8448:~# cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep range
    - --service-cluster-ip-range=10.96.0.0/12
```

Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?
```
➜ root@cka8448:~# find /etc/cni/net.d/
/etc/cni/net.d/
/etc/cni/net.d/.kubernetes-cni-keep
/etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist
/etc/cni/net.d/87-podman-bridge.conflist
```
```
➜ root@cka8448:~# cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
    "name": "weave",
    "plugins": [
        {
            "name": "weave",
            "type": "weave-net",
            "hairpinMode": true
        },
        {
            "type": "portmap",
            "capabilities": {"portMappings": true},
            "snat": true
        }
    ]
}
```
By default the kubelet looks into /etc/cni/net.d to discover the CNI plugins. This will be the same on every controlplane and worker nodes.


Which suffix will static pods have that run on cka8448?
The suffix is the node hostname with a leading hyphen. 

Result
The resulting /opt/course/14/cluster-info could look like:

```
# /opt/course/14/cluster-info

# How many controlplane nodes are available?
1: 1

# How many worker nodes (non controlplane nodes) are available?
2: 0

# What is the Service CIDR?
3: 10.96.0.0/12

# Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?
4: Weave, /etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist

# Which suffix will static pods have that run on cka8448?
5: -cka8448
```

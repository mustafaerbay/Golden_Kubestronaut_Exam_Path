# Question 13 | Multi Containers and Pod shared Volume
Solve this question on: ssh cka3200

Create a Pod with multiple containers named multi-container-playground in Namespace default:

It should have a volume attached and mounted into each container. The volume shouldn't be persisted or shared with other Pods

Container c1 with image nginx:1-alpine should have the name of the node where its Pod is running on available as environment variable MY_NODE_NAME

Container c2 with image busybox:1 should write the output of the date command every second in the shared volume into file date.log. You can use while true; do date >> /your/vol/path/date.log; sleep 1; done for this.

Container c3 with image busybox:1 should constantly write the content of file date.log from the shared volume to stdout. You can use tail -f /your/vol/path/date.log for this.

Answer:
First we create the Pod template:

```
➜ ssh cka3200

➜ candidate@cka3200:~$ k run multi-container-playground --image=nginx:1-alpine --dry-run=client -o yaml > 13.yaml
```
And add the other containers and the commands they should execute:
```
# cka3200:/home/candidate/13.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: multi-container-playground

          fieldPath: spec.nodeName                                                # add

      mountPath: /vol                                                             # add
  - image: busybox:1                                                              # add
    name: c3                                                                      # add

    volumeMounts:                                                                 # add

  volumes:                                                                        # add
    - name: vol                                                                   # add
      emptyDir: {}                                                                # add
status: {}
```

Well, there was a lot requested here! We check if everything is good with the Pod:

```
➜ candidate@cka3200:~$ k -f 13.yaml create
pod/multi-container-playground created

➜ candidate@cka3200:~$ k get pod multi-container-playground
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
multi-container-playground   3/3     Running   0          47s
```
Not a bad start. Now we check if container c1 has the requested node name as env variable:
```
➜ candidate@cka3200:~$ k exec multi-container-playground -c c1 -- env | grep MY
MY_NODE_NAME=cka3200
```
And finally we check the logging, which means that c2 correctly writes and c3 correctly reads and outputs to stdout:
```
➜ candidate@cka3200:~$ k logs multi-container-playground -c c3

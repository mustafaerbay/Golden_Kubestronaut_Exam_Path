# Question 17 | Operator, CRDs, RBAC, Kustomize
Solve this question on: ssh cka6016


There is Kustomize config available at /opt/course/17/operator. It installs an operator which works with different CRDs. It has been deployed like this:
```
kubectl kustomize /opt/course/17/operator/prod | kubectl apply -f -
```
Perform the following changes in the Kustomize base config:

- The operator needs to list certain CRDs. Check the logs to find out which ones and adjust the permissions for Role operator-role
- Add a new Student resource called student4 with any name and description
- Deploy your Kustomize config changes to prod.

### Answer:
Kustomize is a standalone tool to manage K8s Yaml files, but it also comes included with kubectl. The common idea is to have a base set of K8s Yaml and then override or extend it for different overlays, like done here for prod:

```
➜ ssh cka6016

➜ candidate@cka6016:~$ cd /opt/course/17/operator

➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ ls
base  prod
```


#### Investigate Base
Let's investigate the base first for better understanding:

```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k kustomize base
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: classes.education.killer.sh
spec:
  group: education.killer.sh
...
---
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: students.education.killer.sh
spec:
  group: education.killer.sh
...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: operator
  namespace: NAMESPACE_REPLACE
...
```

Running kubectl kustomize DIR will build the whole Yaml based on whatever is defined in the kustomization.yaml.

In the case above we did build for the base directory, which produces Yaml that is not expected to be deployed just like that. We can see for example that all resources contain namespace: NAMESPACE_REPLACE entries which won't be possible to apply because Namespace names need to be lowercase.

But for debugging it can be useful to build the base Yaml.


#### Investigate Prod
```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k kustomize prod
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: classes.education.killer.sh
spec:
  group: education.killer.sh
...
---
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: students.education.killer.sh
spec:
  group: education.killer.sh
...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: operator
  namespace: operator-prod
...
```
We can see that all resources now have namespace: operator-prod. Also prod adds the additional label project_id: prod_7768e94e-88da-4744-9135-f1e7fbb96daf to the Deployment. The rest is taken from base.


#### Locate Issue
The instructions tell us to check the logs:

```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k -n operator-prod get pod
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
operator-7f4f58d4d9-v6ftw   1/1     Running   0          6m9s
```
```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k -n operator-prod logs operator-7f4f58d4d9-v6ftw
+ true
+ kubectl get students
Error from server (Forbidden): students.education.killer.sh is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:operator-prod:operator" cannot list resource "students" in API group "education.killer.sh" in the namespace "operator-prod"
+ kubectl get classes
Error from server (Forbidden): classes.education.killer.sh is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:operator-prod:operator" cannot list resource "classes" in API group "education.killer.sh" in the namespace "operator-prod"
+ sleep 10
+ true
```

We can see that the operator tries to list resources students and classes. If we look at the Deployment we can see that it simply runs kubectl commands in a loop:
```
# kubectl -n operator-prod edit deploy operator
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
...
  name: operator
  namespace: operator-prod
spec:
...
  template:
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]
        args:
          - |
            set -x
            while true; do
              kubectl get students
              kubectl get classes
              sleep 60
            done
...
```

#### Adjust RBAC
Now we need to adjust the existing Role operator-role. In the Kustomize config directory we find file rbac.yaml which we need to edit. Instead of manually editing the Yaml we could also generate it via command line:

```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k -n operator-prod create role operator-role --verb list --resource student --resource class -oyaml --dry-run=client
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: operator-role
  namespace: operator-prod
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - education.killer.sh
  resources:
  - students
  - classes
  verbs:
  - list
```

Now we copy&paste it into rbac.yaml:

```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ vim base/rbac.yaml
# cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator/base/rbac.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: operator-role
  namespace: default
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - education.killer.sh
  resources:
  - students
  - classes
  verbs:
  - list
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: operator-rolebinding
  namespace: default
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: operator
    namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: operator-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

And we deploy:
```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ kubectl kustomize /opt/course/17/operator/prod | kubectl apply -f -
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/classes.education.killer.sh unchanged
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/students.education.killer.sh unchanged
serviceaccount/operator unchanged
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/operator-role configured
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/operator-rolebinding unchanged
deployment.apps/operator unchanged
class.education.killer.sh/advanced unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student1 unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student2 unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student3 unchanged
```

We can see that only the Role was configured, which is what we want. And the logs are not throwing errors any more:

```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k -n operator-prod logs operator-7f4f58d4d9-v6ftw
+ kubectl get students
NAME       AGE
student1   22m
student2   22m
student3   22m
+ kubectl get classes
NAME       AGE
advanced   20m
```

#### Create new Student resource
Finally we need to create a new Student resource. Here we can simply copy an existing one in students.yaml:

```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ vim base/students.yaml
# cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator/base/students.yaml
...
apiVersion: education.killer.sh/v1
kind: Student
metadata:
  name: student3
spec:
  name: Carol Williams
  description: A student excelling in container orchestration and management
---
apiVersion: education.killer.sh/v1
kind: Student
metadata:
  name: student4
spec:
  name: Some Name
  description: Some Description
```

And we deploy:
```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ kubectl kustomize /opt/course/17/operator/prod | kubectl apply -f -
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/classes.education.killer.sh unchanged
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/students.education.killer.sh unchanged
serviceaccount/operator unchanged
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/operator-role unchanged
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/operator-rolebinding unchanged
deployment.apps/operator unchanged
class.education.killer.sh/advanced unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student1 unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student2 unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student3 unchanged
student.education.killer.sh/student4 created
```
```
➜ candidate@cka6016:/opt/course/17/operator$ k -n operator-prod get student
NAME       AGE
student1   28m
student2   28m
student3   27m
student4   43s
```

Only Student student4 got created, everything else stayed the same.

# Question 15 | NetworkPolicy
Solve this question on: ssh cka7968

There was a security incident where an intruder was able to access the whole cluster from a single hacked backend Pod.

To prevent this create a NetworkPolicy called np-backend in Namespace project-snake. It should allow the backend-* Pods only to:

Connect to db1-* Pods on port 1111

Connect to db2-* Pods on port 2222

Use the app Pod labels in your policy.
